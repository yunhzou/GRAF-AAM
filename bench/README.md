# Benchmark code and reproduction guide

Results and provenance: [paper index](../reports/README.md). Current entry
points live here; saved data live in `reports/`. Frozen campaign drivers
previously mixed with the results are now in [archive/](archive/README.md),
unchanged byte-for-byte. Their original staging requirements still apply.
No benchmark needs rerunning merely to inspect saved mappings or metrics.

Use the [two shared viewer styles](../docs/VIEWERS.md). R/P and TS comparisons
use the restored original white-panel renderer; benchmark-specific skins are
retired. `missing_pattern_display_data.py` prepares the three-case witnesses and
`tools/render_mapping_comparison.py` renders them through the shared module.

## Publication entry points

| Script/location | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `prepare_golden_benchmark.py` | Prepare pinned Golden inputs |
| `golden_publication.py` | Golden campaign orchestration and scoring |
| `golden_evaluation.py`, `golden_checkpoint_evaluation.py` | Reference-family evaluation of saved outputs |
| `golden_competitors.py`, `golden_slap_budget.py` | Prior-method adapters and SLAP budget/sweep comparison |
| `final_end_to_end.py` | Fresh coordinate search and public decoding, with stage timing and watchdogs |
| `summarize_final_timing.py`, `plot_final_timing.py` | Final pipeline timing summary and plot |
| `benchmark_saved_decoding.py`, `decode_saved_events.py` | Separate decoder measurement and saved-result inspection |
| `contracts/` | Versioned regression expectations |
| `experiments/` | Optional research variants outside the published default |
| `archive/campaigns/` | Original historical campaign drivers, with unchanged hashes |

The four profiling scripts `benchmark_fragment_detection.py`,
`benchmark_fragment_seed.py`, `benchmark_initial_fragment_stage.py`, and
`benchmark_orbit_preparation.py` moved here from `tools/`.
`hpc/` retains batch launch examples. Use `--help` before launching a new run;
original inputs are required and are not silently regenerated or downloaded.
The saved protocol/source pins govern historical reproduction; current defaults
must not be substituted for an older campaign's configuration.

The other Golden scripts record diagnostic experiments (seeds, caps, direction,
anchors, ranking, memory, viewers). They are retained for provenance, not silently
included in the fixed-policy paper protocol. Source relocations and removal of superseded visual artifacts are recorded in
[the cleanup manifest](../docs/publication_cleanup_20260916.json). Numerical
evidence, witness archives, and recorded source hashes are preserved.

## Reproduce safely

1. Select a run through the paper index and inspect its manifest, frozen engine,
   environment, inputs and submission records. Preserve dataset/source pins and
   random seeds; the exact historical settings take precedence over current defaults.
2. Use a new output directory for any fresh experiment. Never initialize or rerun
   workers into a published run merely to inspect its results.
3. Reuse saved mappings for evaluation/figures. Write new analyses separately and
   retain evaluator/source identity. Include missing/invalid outcomes in denominators.
4. Retain intermediate/final mappings, attempt logs, per-case timing, retries and
   accounting along with the report. Push compact evidence; retain large cluster
   banks at the documented paths.

Inspect current CLI options without starting a run:

```bash
python bench/golden_publication.py --help
python bench/collect_golden_patterns.py --help
python bench/golden_competitors.py --help
python bench/golden_slap_budget.py --help
```

The competitor execution environment is separately pinned at:

```text
/project/yunhengzou/coordinate_alignment/aam_benchmarks/competitor_env_20260908/bin/python
```

Evaluation/adapter regression checks (not a fresh chemistry benchmark):

```bash
python -m pytest -q tests/test_golden_evaluation.py tests/test_golden_competitors.py tests/test_golden_slap_budget.py
```
